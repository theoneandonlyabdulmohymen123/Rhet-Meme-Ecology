            <div class="introduction-text"><p class="text">The “For the better, right” meme also known as <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/for-the-better-right">clueless Padme</a> has taken the world by storm. 
                This website is dedicated to discussing the origins and rhetorical impact of this meme as will as the different forms it has taken over the years. 
                Taken from the 2002 Star Wars: Episode II - attack of the clones, the only part of the movie that is actually in the meme is the visual four-image panel,
                 as for the quotes, it is never actually said in the movie, rather it has been created by a Twitter account that posts fake Star Wars quotes.</p> 
                 <h1 class="section-title-2">Significance</h1>
                <p class="text">The meme slowly started gaining traction across various subreddits. After the meme
                     has been posted on /r/dankmemes it has gained 83,200 upvotes in 12 days. Surprisingly
                      one of the versions of the meme that went viral was one that displayed that the dialogue the 
                      characters were having was indeed fake.

        <div class="iterations-content">
            <div class="meme-iteration-1"></div>
            <div><p class="text">This iteration of the meme points to the actual creating of the meme. The caption on the panel display anakin saying he’s 
                going to make a prequel meme, and then padme responding with “Based on actual dialogoue, right?” which makes fun of the original meme.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="iterations-content">
            <div class="meme-iteration-2"></div>
            <div><p class="text">This another iteration that was unique and had well played elements, the visual panel perfectly captures that expressions and emotions one would have when reacting to the captions put on the meme. 
                This meme also plays a role in real life with spreading a specific rhetoric or an idea: Insurance doesn’t cover medical bills like one would expect.</p></div>
